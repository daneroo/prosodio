# Workflow

Backlog -> plan -> implement (small commits) -> done. Everything in `thoughts/`
is transient except `BACKLOG.md`.

Filenames in `thoughts/` are lowercase kebab; only `BACKLOG.md` is capitalized.
(`docs/` is UPPERCASE by convention; `thoughts/` is not.)

## Backlog — `thoughts/BACKLOG.md`

Unscheduled work. One issue per top-level item; the templates here are the
schema (a validator can enforce them later).

```md
- [ ] <id> — <imperative title>
  - why: <one line>
  - <nested detail / sub-point / ref>
```

- `<id>`: stable lowercase kebab slug, unique; doubles as the plan filename
  (e.g. `catalog-workflow-doc`, `mdx-linting`, `epoch1-transcribe`).
- Nest freely for detail; no prose paragraphs.
- `[x]` when the issue's plan is done and merged. The backlog keeps the record.

## Plan — `thoughts/plans/<id>.md`

Written when an issue is scheduled. One issue, small enough for clear steps.

```md
# <id> — <title>

Status: planned | active | done

Goal: <one line>.

- [ ] step
- [ ] step
```

- Status: `planned` (not started) -> `active` (in progress) -> `done` (closed).
- Steps are checkboxes — the agent's live progress tracker; tick as you go.
- Optional notes beside it: `<id>-research.md`, `<id>-review.md`, only if
  warranted.
- Closing: tick `[x]` in BACKLOG and commit that; the backlog keeps the record.
  A `done` plan may then be either deleted or moved to `plans/archive/<id>.md`
  and kept while it's still useful — as a worked exemplar, or because live
  backlog items still reference it. Archived plans are not permanent: prune them
  once nothing depends on them. The backlog, not the archive, is the durable
  record.

## Design — `thoughts/design/<id>-design.md`

Working system design: problem, constraints, alternatives, decisions, and open
questions. Designs explain what should be built and why; plans turn the chosen
design into executable checkboxes.

- Prefer the plan's exact `<id>` plus `-design`, so `plans/epoch4-alignment.md`
  and `design/epoch4-alignment-design.md` sort and search together naturally.
- A design may span several plan steps, but should still have one clear topic.
- Superseded design drafts are consolidated rather than accumulated; Git keeps
  their history.
- When implementation settles the design, move any still-useful operational
  facts into code, tests, package/app documentation, or durable `docs/` as
  appropriate, then delete the transient design.

## Scale-up path

When the flat backlog hurts — real dependencies between issues, or it outgrows a
screen — adopt a git-native tracker (e.g. beads); it ingests this list
trivially. Cross-repo aggregation is its own problem, out of scope here.
